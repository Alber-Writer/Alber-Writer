# Hi 👋, I'm Alberto Escribano!
### 🚀 I love building web interfaces, combining Front-End Development with effective Designs.
---
- 📖 I have worked in the field of graphic/web design and development for many years, creating a significant number of HTML, CSS and JS landing pages, websites and components from scratch.

- 🧭 I have also build blogs and online stores using platforms such as Wordpress, Prestashop and Opencart.

- 🗺️ In my career, I have had the opportunity to work with all kinds of clients, from small stores to internationally renowned brands.

- 🔎 I am committed to ongoing professional development in technology and visual communication. My current objective is to join projects where I can leverage my experience and expand my front-end skills in libraries and frameworks such as React, Angular, or VUE.
